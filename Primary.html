                                familiarise themselves with the “big school” for the move to our Windsor Park campus,
                                and a Year 6 transition programme to prepare our students for Secondary school. Every

                                beyond the classroom and understand that learning is far more than just what takes place

                                a classroom. Examples of our enrichment experiences include outdoor learning in our

                    <p class="text-secondary mx-1"><small class="text-muted">Our Primary Curriculum is exciting,
                            relevant to today’s world and inspiring. We
                            believe children
                            learn best when they are motivated, curious and inspired. Based upon the English National
                            Curriculum
                            (ENC), our aim is for children to gain a broad understanding of the core and foundation
                            subjects,
                            alongside the English language skills they need for the next stages in their education.
                            Throughout
                            their primary education, we want our children to discover their passions and develop their
                            independent thinking skills, allowing them to become happy, creative, moral
                            individuals.</small></p>
                    <p class="text-secondary mx-1"><small class="text-muted">We use a thematic approach to learning in
                            the Primary school. It is the way of
                            teaching and learning
                            where many areas of the curriculum are connected together and integrated within a theme. it
                            allows
                            learning to be more relevant and students can see clearly how skills become transferable to
                            different areas of learning. So for example, a year group may have a theme of ‘The
                            Rainforest’.
                            It
                            is relevant to the world today, and their future so makes it far more interesting and
                            engaging.
                            In
                            English they may do reading of texts around the rainforests, writing including reports and
                            fact
                            files about deforestation and fiction writing imagining they are animals in the
                            rainforest.The
                            speaking and listening element may focus on debating the pros and cons of deforestation,
                            with
                            drama
                            focusing on life in the rainforest. In science they may learn about habitats of animals in
                            the
                            rainforests and plants and their growth. In history, students may explore the history of the
                            indigineous people of the rainforest and in geography learn about the locations of
                            rainforests
                            around the world and climate. Music may include recreating noises and sounds of the
                            rainforest,
                            an
                            art may have a focus on transforming their classroom into a rainforest.</small></p>

                        purpose for the learning. If a subject does not lend itself to a thematic approach, for example
                        mathematics, then this is taught as a discrete subject.</small></p>
