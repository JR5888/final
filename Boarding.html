                            programme offers our students more than just a place to live while they are away from home;
                            it gives them the opportunity to thrive in their work and also in their friendships. The
                            most important aspect of our boarding programme is the care a support given to your child.
                            We ensure that each student that boards at Bromsgrove is given the opportunity to work to
                            the best of their ability by offering them further support, encouragement and individual
                            care outside of school hours.</small></p>

                    <p class="text-secondary mx-1"><small class="text-muted">Boarding offers our students the chance to
                            succeed beyond the classroom. It does this not only by encouraging each one of our students
                            to become independent, well rounded and confident beings but also by providing them with the
                            supportive working environment that they need in order to achieve the grades they work
                            towards during the school day.</small></p>
                    <h4 class="text-left mt-2 text-danger mx-1">What do we offer?</h4>
                    <p class="text-secondary mx-1"><small class="text-muted">A friendly and welcoming environment where
                            students can feel relaxed and at home. We are proud to offer boarding facilities which are
                            second to none. Located on a thirty-six hole golf course with stunning panoramic views our
                            boarders are able to take advantage of all that is offered to them. Space for them to work
                            out of school hours, football pitches, swimming facilities, sports equipment and courts are
                            all just at a glance from their windows in Windsor and Tudor house. Our two modern and
                            inviting boarding houses offer our boarders comfort and space to relax, work and spend time
                            with friends.</small></p>

                    <h5 class="mx-1">Flexi Boarding</h5>
                    <p class="text-secondary mx-1"><small class="text-muted">Flexi Boarding provides opportunities for
                            last minute and one off stays in Boarding. Many parents use this option throughout the term
                            for last minute business trips, family emergencies or for their child to experience life in
                            Boarding before moving to a weekly or full boarder. Other students chose to stay for school
                            events and competitions, especially at weekends.</small></p>
                    <p class="text-secondary mx-1"><small class="text-muted">As part of our flexi boarding, we also
                            offer students the chance to stay after school and take part in the Enrichment and Academic
                            programme between 15:30 and 18:00 every Monday to Thursday, with dinner provided.</small>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-secondary mx-1"><small class="text-muted">Throughout the term there will be other
                            opportunities where day students are invited to stay in Boarding from different events
                            throughout the year or as part of our weekend trips.</small></p>
                    <h5 class="mx-1">Weekly Boarding</h5>
                    <p class="text-secondary mx-1"><small class="text-muted">Weekly Boarding at Bromsgrove International
                            School Bangkok is described as “the best of both worlds”. Our five day school week offers
                            our students the opportunity to spend time in the week focusing and working towards success
                            so that on a Friday afternoon, when they return home, they can spend quality time with their
                            families. The advantage that this will give your child is that they will mature with the
                            independence and confidence which boarding will give them and you, as the parents are able
                            to watch them grow into young adults. Weekly boarding cuts out the daily travel to and from
                            the school allowing the students to have more time to learn and relax during the week rather
                            than sitting in Bangkok traffic for up to 20 hours per week.</small></p>
                    <h5 class="mx-1">Full Boarding</h5>
                    <p class="text-secondary mx-1"><small class="text-muted">Over half of the Boarding community at BIST
                            are full boarders, who have moved to BIST from places all over the world including the UK,
                            South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Russia, South America, Europe and Koh Samui. For Full
                            Boarders, Boarding at BIST really is their home and it provides them with opportunities to
                            develop independence and rest and relax with their friends, whilst also taking part in
                            weekly trips around Bangkok.</small></p>
