                <p class="text-danger">I extend a very warm welcome to you and your child from everyone at our
                    Bromsgrove Early Years
                    campus. Bromsgrove Early Years, established in 2002, is a fun, happy and vibrant campus for
                    young children aged 2-6 years old. Our highly experienced teaching staff, qualified TA’s and
                    accomplished nannies provide an outstanding child-to-adult ratio to support and enhance your
                    child’s school experience. I look forward to welcoming you to our wonderful campus to come and
                    meet the team.</p>
                <hr class="text-danger">
                <p>At Bromsgrove Early Years we believe all children should be captivated
                    by their learning from a young age, so that an exciting journey to a lifelong love of
                    learning will evolve. We strive to provide a rich and positive start to a child’s education
                    which lays a solid, happy and memorable foundation for their future progress through the
                    school. We nurture and support each learning experience helping your child to explore,
                    investigate, discover and create.</p>
                <p>Through a combination of ‘environment’ and our ‘play based learning’ we aim to develop the potential
                    in each and every one of our students. We understand that a child’s right and left brain develops at
                    different stages and we therefore strive to capture the learning potential of each. We ensure that
                    we develop a child’s right brain with empathy, intuition, imagination and creativity as well as
                    developing the more the logical left brain, with the development of language, literacy and
                    mathematics. We believe by laying these educational foundations your child will thrive and be able
                    to follow their dreams!</p>
                <p>Young children are the future and at Bromsgrove Early Years School we endeavour to make each child
                    feel like an individual who has the same opportunities and experiences that they would receive in a
                    traditional British independent school, whilst at the same time learning about the local Thai
                    culture of our host country. We celebrate being located in an international setting and as such
                    provide the opportunity for children to develop an awareness of the international world in which
                    they live, through festivals and cultural celebrations.</p>

                        teaching so that each learning experience is given at the right stage of each child’s

                        <p><small class="text-muted"></small>EEnglish language acquisition is key to children’s success in all areas of the curriculum. This means that stories, music and conversation play an important role in all lessons. We also understand the importance of physical development and so all children have specialist sports provision. From Nursery Class onwards the children have swimming lessons in our school swimming pool. In addition, to ensure that children are alert and able to make use of our excellent facilities, Pre-Nursery and Nursery children have the option of a rest/sleep after lunch.</small></p>
