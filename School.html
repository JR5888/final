                    <p><small class="text-muted">At Bromsgrove we recognise the importance of an
                            academically
                            rigorous
                            education; it is important that pupils are stretched in order to make good progress and
                            ultimately gain the best achievable set of academic qualifications. However, there is
                            more
                            to a quality education than this and we are also committed to producing individuals that
                            are
                            fully prepared for life beyond school and who possess the skills and personal qualities
                            to
                            succeed in a changing and increasingly globalised world. There are many ways in which we
                            achieve this; in our Early Years and Primary Sections we build the foundations of a
                            ‘love of
                            learning’ and the fundamental skills that will ensure they become life-long learners. We
                            also provide a balanced and accessible programme of extra-curricular activities; a
                            world-class boarding environment; excellent pastoral care and a commitment to improving
                            levels of confidence, inquiry and communication as a student moves up through the
                            school.
                            These experiences will ultimately help them to be happy and successful both at school
                            and
                            beyond.</small></p>
                    <p><small class="text-muted">The Bromsgrove curriculum is a seamless
                            continuum
                            based on the
                            English
                            National Curriculum, but also where the Asian influence enriches all that we do. Each
                            section of the school effectively prepares a student for the next so that their
                            education is
                            smooth, continuous and each stage builds on the progress made in the previous one. Our
                            Early
                            Years Campus is ideal preparation for the Primary School, which in turn equips our
                            students
                            with the necessary skills and grounding to succeed at Secondary School. The end result
                            is
                            that parents do not have to worry about their child’s education being disrupted by them
                            having to settle in to different schools and make new friends.</small></p>

                    <p class="text-secondary mx-1"><small class="text-muted">At Bromsgrove Early Years we believe
                            that
                            everyday when children arrive to our campus a new adventure and a love of learning begins.
                            The learning potential for all young children is an exciting journey and it is our privilege
                            to work with your child to support, guide and most importantly unleash their love for
                            learning. At our small, safe and friendly campus we pride ourselves on the individual care
                            and attention given to all of our students. Our excellent staff to student ratio is such
                            that each child truly receives the support that they need. Bromsgrove Early Years is a happy
                            and vibrant environment where children discover learning is everywhere – you can see our
                            children counting and collecting flowers, colouring and writing letters, riding a tandem
                            trike with friends, reading a book in a teepee or being curious and creative designing a
                            reservoir in the sandpit. Most importantly though, you can see confident and creative
                            children sharing their ideas, helping each other, being kind and being determined to achieve
                            success.</small></p>
                    <p class="text-secondary mx-1"><small class="text-muted">We ensure that the children’s English
                            is
                            developed at this early stage of their education to equip them with the skills to succeed
                            throughout the Early Years into Primary School and beyond. The fundamentals of language and
                            numeracy are supported by creative learning, decision making and problem solving that make
                            our students curious, independent and more effective learners. Our Head of Early Years
                            Campus and Head of Primary work closely together to ensure that the transition to our
                            Primary School is smooth and that the learning is continuous. Primary School staff often
                            visit the Early Years campus so that the students know who they are and our Early Years
                            students also often visit our Windsor Park Campus so they are familiar with the school
                            environment.</small></p>

                    <p class="text-secondary mx-1"><small class="text-muted">Within the Primary School, students receive
                            the fundamental building blocks of a quality academic education. A strong emphasis is placed
                            on English, numeracy, science and computing. At the same time, through the development of
                            key skills such as responsibility, resourcefulness and resilience we make our Primary
                            students intellectually curious and better learners, while also building self-esteem and
                            emotional intelligence. In this way we can accelerate their progress and prepare them more
                            effectively for the challenges of our Secondary School and even life beyond. The Head of
                            Primary works very closely with the Secondary School to ensure that the transition to the
                            Secondary School is seamless. The students are perfectly prepared for their Year 7
                            transition, are familiar with the teachers and the campus and will move through the school
                            with their friends.</small></p>

                    <p class="text-secondary mx-1"><small class="text-muted">We are rightly proud of being able to
                            provide a world-class boarding school experience based upon the very best traditions of the
                            British Boarding School system. There are many benefits that boarding can bring to the
                            individual pupil in terms of their independence, confidence and academic progress; it really
                            is the ideal preparation for university life and beyond. The boarding experience also
                            represents more of an immersion into an English Speaking environment and so levels of
                            English are likely to improve at a quicker pace. The friendships made in boarding will also
                            last a lifetime; as a former Bromsgrove boarder once said, “the best thing about boarding is
                            that I get to live with my best friends!” The boarding community at Bromsgrove is staffed by
                            an experienced and dedicated team. This helps us to ensure a safe, supportive and consistent
                            environment where boarders receive a balance of academic support, practical activities and
                            free time to relax with their friends. Our weekly boarders choose to go home on a Friday
                            afternoon and spend the weekend with their families before returning to school on Sunday
                            evening or Monday morning. Because of the structured support they receive during the week
                            and the extra time they have saved by not having to travel to and from school, our weekly
                            boarders are much more able to relax and enjoy time with their families. For this reason
                            many students and families regard weekly boarding as ‘the best of both worlds’. We take care
                            of the academic support, the motivation and the structure during the week so that family
                            time is literally just that.</small></p>

                    <p class="text-secondary mx-1"><small class="text-muted">Pastoral care deals with the overall
                            welfare and development of a student and as such is central to the achievement of our
                            mission statement. It is important that every student in the school has an adult who takes a
                            specific interest in their development, welfare, progress and achievements. On our Early
                            Years Campus and in the Primary School this is the class teacher who forms a central part of
                            their lives on a day-to-day basis. As a student enters the Secondary School their lives in
                            the school become more disparate as they begin to be taught by subject specialists. At this
                            point every student is part of a tutor group, their Form Tutor meets them daily for
                            registration and is turn they act as a central focus for that student and their parents.
                            Ultimately, this means that every student is supported in achieving their individual
                            potential and gets the most out of their time at the school.</small></p>
